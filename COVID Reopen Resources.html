<em>Bearing in mind the Traditions, here are questions your group may wish to consider</em>:
<ul>
    <li>Has your home group scheduled a group conscience or business meeting to consider resuming face-to-face meetings?</li>
    <li>Is your group familiar with the latest CDC, state, and local regulations concerning large group meetings? Where can these regulations be found? How can these regulations be communicated to the group?</li>
    <li>Has your group considered how its actions and decisions could affect other groups, or could affect AA as a whole?</li>
    <li>Will your group’s regular meeting place limit capacity while following government mandates regarding physical distancing? If not, how will your group meet the needs of alcoholics and also avoid controversy?</li>
    <li>Will your home group consider the use of online or call-in meetings during live, face- to-face meetings and why would this option be considered? If online or call-in meetings are utilized during a live, face-to-face meeting, will this raise issues of anonymity?</li>
    <li>Concerning COVID-19, should our group be concerned with any legal liability issues? If so, what might these be?</li>
    <li>Will hospitality service continue? If so, what safety measures could your group adopt?</li>
    <li>Will your group supply hand sanitizer? If not, how will your group conduct meetings safely?</li>
    <li>Will your group continue to share literature between members during in-person meetings?</li>
    <li>If masks are required, will your group supply a mask for those without one? Will the greeter’s role be expanded to offer masks? Will there be a need to create new group service commitments regarding safety? Will a member be asked to leave if they do not wear a mask—And how can this be handled lovingly?</li>
    <li>How will your group practice Tradition 7? Has your group considered vectors in passing a physical basket? If so, how can the basket be passed safely?</li>
    <li>How has your group considered following government regulations in light of practicing the Traditions—specifically Traditions 4, 5, 10 and 11?</li>
</ul>
