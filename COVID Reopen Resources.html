<em>Bearing in mind the Traditions, here are questions your group may wish to consider</em>:
<ul>
    <li>Has your home group scheduled a group conscience or business meeting to consider resuming face-to-face meetings?</li>
    <li>Is your group familiar with the latest CDC, state, and local regulations concerning large group meetings? Where can these regulations be found? How can these regulations be communicated to the group?</li>
    <li>Has your group considered how its actions and decisions could affect other groups, or could affect AA as a whole?</li>
    <li>Will your group’s regular meeting place limit capacity while following government mandates regarding physical distancing? If not, how will your group meet the needs of alcoholics and also avoid controversy?</li>
    <li>Will your home group consider the use of online or call-in meetings during live, face- to-face meetings and why would this option be considered? If online or call-in meetings are utilized during a live, face-to-face meeting, will this raise issues of anonymity?</li>
    <li>Concerning COVID-19, should our group be concerned with any legal liability issues? If so, what might these be?</li>
    <li>Will hospitality service continue? If so, what safety measures could your group adopt?</li>
    <li>Will your group supply hand sanitizer? If not, how will your group conduct meetings safely?</li>
    <li>Will your group continue to share literature between members during in-person meetings?</li>
    <li>If masks are required, will your group supply a mask for those without one? Will the greeter’s role be expanded to offer masks? Will there be a need to create new group service commitments regarding safety? Will a member be asked to leave if they do not wear a mask—And how can this be handled lovingly?</li>
    <li>How will your group practice Tradition 7? Has your group considered vectors in passing a physical basket? If so, how can the basket be passed safely?</li>
    <li>How has your group considered following government regulations in light of practicing the Traditions—specifically Traditions 4, 5, 10 and 11?</li>

<!--  HYBRID MEETINGS  -->

<p>As groups resume regular face to face meetings, the question arises of what to do with their online meetings?</p>
<ol>
    <li class="compact-list" style="margin:.5em 0">Discontinue online meetings</li>
    <li class="compact-list" style="margin:.5em 0">Continue holding online meetings in addition to REOPENED regular meetings as entirely separate meetings
        (These might be held on the same days and times <b>but would NOT be considered HYBRID</b>)</li>
    <li class="compact-list" style="margin:.5em 0">Hold online meetings alongside REOPENED regular meetings as <b>HYBRID meetings</b>
</ol>
<p>A <b><em>HYBRID meeting</em></b> is the practice of holding a regular face to face meeting and an online meeting simultaneously as <b>one single blended or HYBRID meeting</b>.</p>
PROS:
<ul>
    <li class="compact-list">Allows your group to overcome attendance capacity limits at your physical venue.</li>
    <ul>
        <li class="compact-list-2">Participants arriving after the limit is reached, could easily and quickly join the meeting from outside the venue, such as from the comfort of their vehicle</li>
        <li class="compact-list-2" style="list-style:none; margin-left: 3em"><strong>OR</strong></li>
        <li class="compact-list-2">someone already inside could volunteer their spot to another in more need, such as a newcomer or a member without the ability to join an online meeting
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li class="compact-list">Allows a member in a high risk group or with accessibility issues to participate in regular meetings
    </li>
</ul>
CONS:
<ul>
    <li class="compact-list">There are various issues, both practical and technical, that need to be worked out to allow these meetings to run smoothly
        <ul>
            <li class="compact-list-2" >Anonymity concerns</li>
            <li class="compact-list-2">Is there a good Internet connection at the venue?</li>
            <li class="compact-list-2">How to avoid having multiple people handle a microphone or other device, or do so in a safe manner</li>
            <li style="list-style:none;" class="compact-list-2"><b>&hellip; to list but a few</b></li>
        </ul>

    </li>
    <li class="compact-list">There may be those who wish to participate in a regular face to face meeting, but do not want to be part of an online meeting
    </li>
    <li class="compact-list">May discourage attendance at face to face meetings, when to do so would be possible and advantageous

<!-- Hybrid Meetings - Examples -->

<strong>From a recent SENY Tech Workshop:</strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.aaseny.org/s/Hybrid-Meetings-Experience-Suggestions.pdf"><img src="https://suffolkny-aa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/acrobatpdf.jpg" alt="" width="60" /><strong>Hybrid Meetings Experience & Suggestions</strong></a></p>

<p><b>Note: </b>On the SIA meeting list, each HYBRID meeting will have two separate meetings listed - one for the face to face or REOPENED portion and one for the ONLINE portion. </p>

    <p>Only the face to face or REOPENED portion of the HYBRID meeting will have the HYBRID note. The ONLINE portion will look like any other ONLINE meeting.</p>

<p><a href="/meetings/?tsml-day=any&tsml-query=freethinkers&tsml-region=stony-brook"><b>STONY BROOK FREETHINKERS</b></a> is an example of a HYBRID meeting. Searching for this group in the Meeting Finder would result in four (4) meetings. Only the REOPENED meetings will have a HYBRID note on their details page.</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Day</th><th>Time</th><th>Type</th><th>Link to Details Page</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Wed</td><td>7:30 PM</td><td>REOPENED / HYBRID</td><td><a href="/meetings/530-wd-0/?tsml-day=any&tsml-query=freethinkers">/530-wd-0/</a></td></tr>

</table>

<p><a href="/meetings/?tsml-day=any&tsml-query=sunrise+reflections"><b>ST JAMES SUNRISE REFLECTIONS</b></a> is an example of a HYBRID meeting where the ONLINE portion is PHONE only. Searching for this group in the Meeting Finder would result in fourteen (14) meetings. Only the REOPENED meetings will have a HYBRID note on their details page.</p>
