<em>Bearing in mind the Traditions, here are questions your group may wish to consider</em>:
<ul>
    <li>Has your home group scheduled a group conscience or business meeting to consider resuming face-to-face meetings?</li>
    <li>Is your group familiar with the latest CDC, state, and local regulations concerning large group meetings? Where can these regulations be found? How can these regulations be communicated to the group?</li>
    <li>Has your group considered how its actions and decisions could affect other groups, or could affect AA as a whole?</li>
    <li>Will your group’s regular meeting place limit capacity while following government mandates regarding physical distancing? If not, how will your group meet the needs of alcoholics and also avoid controversy?</li>
    <li>Will your home group consider the use of online or call-in meetings during live, face- to-face meetings and why would this option be considered? If online or call-in meetings are utilized during a live, face-to-face meeting, will this raise issues of anonymity?</li>
    <li>Concerning COVID-19, should our group be concerned with any legal liability issues? If so, what might these be?</li>
    <li>Will hospitality service continue? If so, what safety measures could your group adopt?</li>
    <li>Will your group supply hand sanitizer? If not, how will your group conduct meetings safely?</li>
    <li>Will your group continue to share literature between members during in-person meetings?</li>
    <li>If masks are required, will your group supply a mask for those without one? Will the greeter’s role be expanded to offer masks? Will there be a need to create new group service commitments regarding safety? Will a member be asked to leave if they do not wear a mask—And how can this be handled lovingly?</li>
    <li>How will your group practice Tradition 7? Has your group considered vectors in passing a physical basket? If so, how can the basket be passed safely?</li>
    <li>How has your group considered following government regulations in light of practicing the Traditions—specifically Traditions 4, 5, 10 and 11?</li>

<!--  HYBRID MEETINGS  -->
<p>As groups resume regular face to face meetings, the question arises of what to do with their online meetings?</p>
<ul>
    <li class="compact-list">Discontinue online meetings</li>
    <li class="compact-list">Continue holding online meetings in addition to their regular meetings as entirely separate meetings
    </li>
    <li class="compact-list">Continue holding online meetings along side their regular meetings as HYBRID meetings
    </li>
</ul>
<p>A <b><em>HYBRID meeting</em></b> is the practice of holding a regular face to face meeting and an online meeting concurrently as <b>one single HYBRID meeting</b>.</p>
PROS:
<ul>
    <li class="compact-list">Allows your group to overcome attendance limits at your physical venue.</li>
    <ul>
        <li class="compact-list-2">Participants arriving after the limit is reached, could easily and quickly join the meeting from outside the venue, such as from the comfort of their vehicle</li>
        <li class="compact-list-2" style="list-style:none; margin-left: 3em"><strong>OR</strong></li>
        <li class="compact-list-2">someone already inside could volunteer their spot to another in more need, such as a newcomer or a member without the ability to join an online meeting
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li class="compact-list">Allows a member in a high risk group or with accessibility issues to participate in regular meetings
    </li>
</ul>
CONS:
<ul>
    <li class="compact-list">There are various issues, both practical and technical, that need to be worked out to allow these meetings to run smoothly (this list is a not exhaustive!)
        <ul>
            <li class="compact-list-2" >Anonymity concerns</li>
            <li class="compact-list-2">Is there a good Internet connection at the venue?</li>
            <li class="compact-list-2">How to avoid having multiple people handle a microphone or other device, or do so in a safe manner</li>
        </ul>

    </li>
    <li class="compact-list">There may be those who wish to participate in a regular face to face meeting, but do not want to be part of an online meeting
    </li>
    <li class="compact-list">May discourage attendance in face to face meetings, when to do so would be possible and advantageous
    </li>
</ul>
