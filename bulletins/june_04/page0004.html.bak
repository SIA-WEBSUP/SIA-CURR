&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I had all of the defects, bar none, &nbsp;so this process took a very , very long time. Getting from the admitting to acceptance was certainly a process that caused me a lot of pain. The reason why the pain was so severe was that I had no trust of the unknown. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So the key to this Step for me was to become entirely ready and willing to have God remove these defects. In the interim, what I have realized was the only reason I wanted these defects removed was because they were causing me pain. &nbsp;But once I had learned to accept myself for who I was, then, and only then, did I want my defects removed - &nbsp;not because I was in pain - but because I wanted to be a better person and get closer to God; &nbsp;to try and sincerely grow in the image and the likeness of my Creator.

Big Book.

<SPAN STYLE="font-family:Comic Sans MS; font-weight:normal; font-size:11px; color:#000000;">
 We would &nbsp;love to have everyone with 30 plus years to inscribe it and this book will become a permanent part of our archives. &nbsp;The book is available for signing at the SIA monthly meetings at Cleary; The "We're IT" meetings on Saturdays; and the Kings Park Open meetings on Fridays. Contact the Archives for more information.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please read this (or reread as the case may &nbsp;be): Last but not least - the ongoing project to write the history of Alcoholics Anonymous Suffolk County is - well- ongoing. Please send us the story of group(s) or meeting(s). &nbsp;How did it get started; by whom? The histories have been slow in coming in but when they do, they have been wonderful. &nbsp;Unfortunately, far too many meetings have no idea what their histories are. Old-timers have moved away or passed on and tragically these wonderful stories have been lost forever. &nbsp;Please help us preserve our past so we can pass it on to future AAs. This is in keeping with Step 12 of Alcoholics Anonymous; we share our strength, hope, and experience so that others may recover. Your memories are priceless.
