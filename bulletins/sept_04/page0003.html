IT WAS NOT THAT LONG AGO I FOUND MYSELF DESPERATE AND OUT OF CONTROL SPINNING RAPIDLY DOWN THE SPIRAL TOWARD HELL ON EARTH. 
<BR>
AS I WAS ONCE CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE A PILLAR IN SOCIETY, I NOW WAS CONSIDERED AT LEAST BY ME AN OUTCAST. I HAD NO DESIRE TO GO ON IN LIFE AND CONSIDERED IT ALMOST VIRTUOUS TO COMMIT SUICIDE. 
<BR>
MY FATHER DID THAT AND HAD LIVED IMMORTALLY IN MY HEAD EVER SINCE. THAT IS HOW SICK I WAS. TO EVEN CONSIDER SUCH A WASTE OF MY HIGHER POWERS GIFT IS DEPLORABLE TO ME TODAY. WELL WHAT HAPPENED IS I SIMPLY HAD TO ASK THE QUESTION MANY OF US HAD TO ASK.... PLEASE HELP ME! THAT WAS FIRST REAL PRAYER IN MY ENTIRE LIFE THAT WAS SINCERE. 
<BR>
WHAT HAPPENED IS MY HIGHER POWER DECIDED TO GRACE ME WITH A GIFT IMMEDIATELY AND BROUGHT ME TO THE ROOMS OF ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS. IT IS INSIDE THESE ROOMS WHERE I HAD LEARNED I WAS GIVEN A GIFT FROM MY HIGHER POWER AND IT IS UP TO ME WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH THIS GIFT. A FRIEND SAID TO ME THE BEST GIFT I COULD POSSIBLY GIVE MY HIGHER POWER IS ONE DAY AT A TIME CONTINUOUS SOBRIETY AND PLENTY OF SERVICE TO OTHERS

There are roughly 360 groups in Suffolk County. &nbsp;Of that number, Intergroup has a mailing address, and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore regular contact with about 180. &nbsp;Meeting List Chair Alan S. and Corresponding Secretary Jon &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H. are determined to reach out to those "lost" groups. &nbsp;Why?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;First, we often hear from newcomers that the group they first tried to go to was not meeting where or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the list said. &nbsp;How many suffering alcoholics have given up because they couldn't &nbsp;find a meeting &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  we'll never know, but one is too many. &nbsp;So we have to keep the meeting list accurate and &nbsp;up-to-date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the meeting list has grown as large as it can in its current format. &nbsp;To add more groups, we'd have to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; switch to a more expensive booklet format. &nbsp;If we can eliminate "dead" groups, we can avoid this expense. &nbsp;And third, it is the purpose of Intergroup to serve the A.A. groups in Suffolk County. &nbsp;We can't do this if we can't tell you what &nbsp;we're doing and get your feedback.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan and Jon have printed up business reply cards, one for each group on the meeting

 with a narrative of my prodigious service work. I want to tell you about a service job that is difficult. It's held by Walter S. He's the SIA Office Manager. &nbsp;Besides his other duties, he's responsible for getting the people to fill the shifts at the office. &nbsp;There are the regulars who normally take a shift; there are a few more that can be called in as &nbsp;fill-ins. &nbsp;And that's the problem. There are too few people who can be called on.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any of you reading this has ever had the Hotline commitment, "the phones," you have a taste of how difficult it can be getting someone to take the call. &nbsp;I don't know about all the volunteers at the office, but in my own case, and a few of the office regulars that &nbsp;I know, we're retired, so we can fit this into our schedules. So that's why it's important for the Bulletin to reach as many members as possible. No doubt, a percentage of our membership would probably be &nbsp;available to take a three hour shift at the office during the day. &nbsp;Out of the 300 plus A.A. groups in Suffolk, only 40-70 reps show up each month at the SIA meetings. &nbsp;I'm hoping that the group secretaries who get the Bulletin read this in their groups.. To grab &nbsp;their &nbsp;attention, mention that after almost 70 years of research, a way has been found to arrest alcoholism. &nbsp;That information will be in the last sentence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;

Dear Bulletin Readers:
<BR>
Heh, Heh, heh. &nbsp;A little joke there. &nbsp;Actually I'm trying to address this to more than the hundred or so people who actually read the SIA Bulletin; more than the hundred or so involved in service at the Intergroup level. &nbsp;I'm hoping that the group secretaries of the A.A. groups in Suffolk read this (letter) to their groups. &nbsp;If this should happen in half the groups in Suffolk, it will probably be an all-time high in the numbers of alcoholics who read or hear &nbsp;the news from Intergroup.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's the thing. I've filled in occasionally at our SIA office in Patchogue. &nbsp;There are two shifts each day - 9am to 12pm and noon - 3pm. I like the earlier shift myself. &nbsp;I pick up two eggs w/bacon on a roll at the deli, and when I get to the office I turn on my favorite &nbsp;cable news station and enjoy my sandwich and coffee. Life is good. It's a little annoying when the phone rings occasionally, disrupting my after-egg meditations. But hey, service is service. Ir has something to do with the 12th Step &nbsp;or something,. But I'm not here to regale you

Step - carrying the message - is the
<BR>
basic service that our Fellowship 
<BR>
gives; this is our principal aim and
<BR>
the main reason for our existence. &nbsp;Therefore, A.A. is more than a set of principles; it is a society of
<BR>
alcoholics in action, to quote Bill W.
<BR>
What is service? Anything that
<BR>
helps us to reach a fellow sufferer - 
<BR>
 - an actual 12 Step call, a ride to
<BR>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a meeting, &nbsp;a phone call - or -
