, several members of groups on the East End have contacted the Intergroup office to express their desire to initiate greater service activity on both Forks. &nbsp;Specific Interests include Institutions, public Information work, and cooperation with the professional community; and greater participation in Intergroup in general. &nbsp;In response, the Chairman &nbsp;asked the reps to consider moving one Intergroup meeting per quarter to Riverhead, the other two meeting per quarter would remain in Ronkonkoma. &nbsp;A motion was made &nbsp;and seconded to this effect.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reps took the question back to their groups in July, Discussion began in August. &nbsp;We encourage as many East End reps as possible to attend the meetings and take part. &nbsp;The SIA meetings this month is on the &nbsp;14th at the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleary &nbsp;School on Portion Road in Lake Ronkonkoma at &nbsp;8pm.

Big Book Update - We now have the signatures of 62 Suffolk A.A.s with more than 30 years sobriety who have signed our original 1951 Big Book. &nbsp;This project has proven so successful that some A.A.s from Nassau County have asked to be included. But sadly, space limits this project to Suffolk A.A.s &nbsp;only. &nbsp;For more info, contact the SIA office &nbsp;at 654-1150. &nbsp;Look for flyers at your meetings &nbsp;listing where the Big Book will be available to be signed and when.
<BR>
Add to our growing archives history files by sending in a 4X6 photo of your meeting place - outside and inside. &nbsp;No people in the photos please!
<BR>
If you have secretarial skills and can transcribe a tape recording for us, on occasion we have need for this service as we record longtime A.A. members' stories. &nbsp;Contact the Archives. Thanks.

sponsor's help with more people as time went on and I added to my list - people at certain jobs I didn't even know I had; acquaintances, co-workers, and others. 
<BR>
I realized that I no longer had to have that fear of &nbsp;"what if?" &nbsp;Step Nine was about "consciousness" of my actions. I realized that the amends I made were for me to clean my side of the street, and not always expect anything in return. &nbsp;Sometimes the amends did help to mend relationships - as in the case of my family. &nbsp;Some people I had hoped to reestablish contact with - well &nbsp;let's just say they don't send me Christmas cards.
<BR>
As a result of this step the Promises in the Big Book started to come for me. &nbsp;

As far as the working conditions at the office, they are good. &nbsp;There is a room with a couple of easy chairs, shelves of literature, bundles of meeting lists, and a small but growing archives display. &nbsp;The office is comfortable and airconditioned, as is the whole building. &nbsp;In the back is a meeting room used by some of our committees such as the Share-a-thon meeting and the Public Information meeting. &nbsp;There is a computer room; it's kept locked so I can't play Far Cry or Doom 3 at the office. &nbsp;There's even a bathroom (clean at that)! &nbsp;Compared to a lot of service jobs it's a a piece of cake; and when you mention to people that you worked a shift at the SIA office, they start to think you know what you are talking about. &nbsp;Of course when someone calls, I just take a message and pass it on to someone that
