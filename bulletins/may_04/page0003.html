There are roughly 360 Groups listed on the Suffolk County meeting list. &nbsp;Of those 360, about 180 have an address listed with Intergroup, so we are able to contact them. &nbsp;Of those 180 Groups, 70 to 80 send representatives to the monthly SIA business meeting at Cleary School. &nbsp;This is a participation rate of less than 25 percent; fewer than that contribute monetarily. &nbsp;Intergroups in other parts of the country report similar figures.
<BR>

<BR>
The Southeastern Pennsylvania Intergroup found they faced the same lack of participation. &nbsp;They devised a two-part plan to combat the lack of interest in service, which Suffolk Intergroup decided to adopt. The groundwork for the *Philadelphia Plan* was laid in the new SIA by-laws, when the group reps voted to authorize the formation of two new standing committees. 
<BR>

<BR>
The first part of the plan, the formation of a Third Legacy Committee, was discussed in February*s Bulletin. &nbsp;Since that time, Arlene T., SIA*s new Third Legacy Committee chairperson, has attended the exchange meeting at SCCC and booked speaking commitments for the committee, several of which have now been completed. &nbsp;So far, response from both Groups and individuals has been very encouraging. &nbsp;The members of the Groups Arlene has spoken to so far have all shown considerable interest in learning about AA*s service structure and what opportunities for service work are available. &nbsp;After each meeting, two or three people have come forward to volunteer to work in the office or on one of the standing committees.
<BR>

<BR>
We are now ready to launch part two of the *Philadelphia Plan." &nbsp;In Pennsylvania, the Intergroup found that people who were not directly attracted to service work would often become active in service if they were initially introduced to the idea of service beyond the Group level by participating in planning and conducting *social* activities. &nbsp;A regular schedule of this type of activity also meant that a newcomer to AA beyond the Group could be put to work on a project that would come to fruition in a month or two. &nbsp;Th
