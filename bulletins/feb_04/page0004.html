THELMA'S STORY
<SPAN STYLE="font-family:Amery; font-weight:normal; text-align:center; font-size:15px; color:#000000;">

<BR>
</SPAN>
<SPAN STYLE="font-family:Amery; font-weight:normal; text-align:left; font-size:12px; color:#000000;">
Thelma was a participant in a clinical trial at a geriatric pharmaceutical company. Our work was done at a residential facility and nursing home. Half of my team of eight were friends of Bill W. 
<BR>
One day, Jenny A., an RN, asked if she could run out to Wal-Mart at lunch to purchase a large bottle of mouthwash, which a patient named Thelma had requested. 
<BR>
No sooner had Jenny left, when it came to me that Thelma was drinking the mouthwash. Part of the study criteria was that if there were a history of alcoholism, the participating patient must have been sober at least five years. No such history was documented in Thelma's chart. 
<BR>
When Jenny returned, I asked her not to give the bottle to Thelma, told her the thought had come to mind, and asked her to check with the nurses on duty to see if it was appropriate to give it to Thelma. 
<BR>
Jenny returned to relate that as she'd approached the nurses' station, she overheard them say, "Well we used to say the Serenity Prayer all the time." 
<BR>
They were talking about Thelma! Then they related to Jenny that mouthwash and other items containing alcohol had been stolen from the other patients. We did not proceed with Thelma's request, and soon there after, Thelma died of cancer of an unknown origin. It was a sad story, and made me wonder, would this have happened if there had been a Specialneeds Committee and volunteers willing to carry the message to fellow AA's confined to there homes, or to Hospitals, residential facilities, or nursing homes? In this case, the hand of AA had not been there for the alcoholic who needed it. If we had made ourselves known to the facilities, maybe the much-needed support of AA could have been there... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
