alone, and thought I was functioning as a wife and mother, and so I couldn't have a problem. &nbsp;Never mind that my behavior while drinking was far from what it would have been sober. &nbsp;Never mind that my divorce was a consequence of my drinking.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did I feel drawn to A.A.? &nbsp;I went to my first meeting with my defenses up. &nbsp;I had not had a drink in ten months, and I had done it on my own. &nbsp;From my very first meeting, the spirituality so hard to verbalize about A.A. transcended my thoughts and my motives. &nbsp;Just when I would think nothing was being said that could help me, the power of A.A. sharing-if not the words themselves-would overwhelm me.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For me, coming into my first A.A. meeting was like coming home.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What keeps me going to A. A.? &nbsp;The warmth, the understanding, the sharing, the acceptance of me as me, the reminders of what drinking did to all of us.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We buried him yesterday. &nbsp;The County Corner had published the required notices for the next of kin and nobody had claimed the body. &nbsp;It was just his sponsor and myself, no preacher even; ther county doesn't pay for those. &nbsp;Not much of a sendoff, and not the one David had asked for. A cheap coffin, a backhoe dug a hole and that was it. &nbsp;Another old
<BR>
A. A. gone.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had been sober for over 20 years and in A. A. over 30, a stern rigid man who tried to soften his edges and never could.He was a loner, a frnger, and an isloated man at the edge of life's good things. &nbsp;He hung in there and in the end hung himself. &nbsp;I don't know why; I know there had been a diagnosis of senile dementia, and I know that the doctor had added cancer to the list. &nbsp;But I've seen A.A.'s deal with such things before. I don't know why David decided he couldn't. I've known several over the years who just up and walked out life's door one day.
