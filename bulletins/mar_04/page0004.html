STEP 2: CAME TO BELIEVE THAT A POWER GREATER THAN OURSELVES COULD RESTORE US TO SANITY
</SPAN>

AFTER ADMITTING I WAS AN ALCOHOLIC, I FOUND I HAD TO BELIEVE THAT A POWER GREATER THAN MYSELF COULD RESTORE MY SANITY. HAVING BEEN BROUGHT UP BELIEVING IN GOD, YOU WOULD THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE EASY, BUT I HAD A HARD TIME BRINGING GOD FROM THE PAST AND INTO MY LIFE TODAY. WHILE ATTENDING AA MEETINGS I FOUND THAT THE MEMBERS OF THIS FELLOWSHIP HAD THE SPRITUALITY I WANTED SO DESPERATELY. I KNEW THAT SOMETHING GREATER THEN ME TOOK AWAY MY DESIRE TO DRINK AND STARTED WORKING ON THE CONCEPT OF A HIGHER POWER. 
<BR>
I STARTED TO PRAY, CONCENTRATING ON THE WORDS I WAS SAYING AND STARTED TO FEEL A SENSE OF PEACE AND SERENITY. 
<BR>
I BEGAN READING SPRITUAL LITERATURE AND LISTENING TO AA MEMBERS WHO I FELT POSSESSED THE GREATER SPIRITUALITY. EVERY DAY I ASK FOR GODS WILL TO LIVE ACCORDING TO HIS PLAN FOR ME AND RECEIVE THE GREATEST REWARDS WHEN I AM ABLE TO HELP OTHERS.

STEP 3: MADE A DECISION TO TURN OUR WILL AND OUR LIVES OVER TO THE CARE OF GOD

THE ESSENCE OF THE THIRD STEP IS ACCEPTANCE. 
<BR>
EARLY IN THIS JOURNEY INTO MY SOBRIETY AND A FULL LIFE, I WORKED VERY HARD TO ACCEPT LIFE ON LIFES TERMS, TO ACCEPT THAT MY HIGHER POWER DIDNT BRING ME THIS FAR TO DROP ME ON MY HEAD. 
<BR>
THE FACT IS, EVEN IF THAT WERE THE CASE, MY HEAD IS VERY HARD, AND ALL WOULD BE WELL. I DIDN'T NEED TO WORK SO HARD, JUST ACCEPT THE CARE OF MY HIGHER POWER. I HAVE COME TO BELIEVE THAT THIS EXISTENCE IS A BATTLE OF FEAR AGAINST LOVE. FEAR HAS NO TRUST, IT IS ANGRY, DEPRESSIVE STATE OF BEING THAT MAKES ME SHORT SIGHTED. FOR MANY YEARS I COULDN'T SEE PAST THE LENGTH OF MY ARM, WHICH IS EXACTLY THE DISTANCE BETWEEN A DRINK AND ME. IF I DWELL IN FEAR, I AM DOOMED TO DRINK. LOVE IS THE ONLY WAY OUT, AND FOR ME THAT IS MY HIGHER POWER. THE THIRD STEP SAYS THAT I SHOULD TURN MY WILL AND LIFE OVER TO GOD'S CARE. FRANKLY, WHEN MY PERSPECTIVE COMES FROM A PLACE OF LOVE, I CANNOT HELP BUT LIVE IN THE THIRD STEP AND ACCEPTANCE THAT REQUIRES. TROUBLE STARTS WHEN I AM LIVING IN FEAR. 
<BR>
TODAY, I TURN MY WILL AND LIFE OVER TO GOD'S CARE... TODAY, I WILL STAY SOBER.
