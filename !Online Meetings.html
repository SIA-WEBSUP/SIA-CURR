<p>To Join by phone click the <b>Join by phone</b> button or dial the number manually.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: .5em;">To do this you'll need the phone number, PIN and possibly a PWD.</p>
<p style="margin: .5em 0 .5em 0; text-align: center;">(e.g. +1 222 333 4444 PIN 555 666 777‬# PWD: 888 999)</p>

If you've already moved online via ZOOM and would like your group listed on this site, we can help.

If you haven't done so already we recommend you read up on some 'best practices' for holding zoom meetings: Here are a couple guides courtesy of NY Intergroup :
<ul class="list_no_indent">
    <li><a href="https://www.nyintergroup.org/zoom-protection-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NY Intergroup Zoom Protection Guide</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.nyintergroup.org/remote-meetings/note-on-anonymity-for-zoom-meetings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NY Intergroup Anonymity on Zoom Guide</a></li>
</ul>
To have your meeting listed, we need the following:
<ul class="list_no_indent">
    <li>Group Name</li>
    <li>Meeting Schedule</li>
    <li>Connection Info</li>
</ul>
The Connection Info includes one or more of the following:
<ul class="list_no_indent">
    <li><b>URL :</b> <code>//zoom.us/j/691630673</code></li>
    <li style="list-style: none; margin-left: 4em;"><b>OR</b></li>
    <li style="list-style: none; margin-left: 1em;"><code>//zoom.us/j/691630673?pwd=c085c0o...93UT09</code></li>
    <li><b>Meeting ID :</b> 691 630 673</li>
    <li><b>Passcode :</b> 850 366</li>
    <li><b>Phone :</b> +1 (646) 558-8656</li>
    <li><b>One Tap Phone :</b> +1 (646) 558-8656,,691 630 673#,,#850 366#</li>
</ul>

    <p><b>As of Sept 27<sup>th</sup> 2020, all Zoom meetings must have either a Passcode or a Waiting Room or both.</b></p>
</div>
Different groups have opted for different levels of 'security' with regards to their zoom meeting passcode.
<ul class="list_no_indent">
    <li>the <b>Join with Zoom</b> button will allow a user to join the meeting without having to manually enter the meeting ID</li>
    <li>if your meeting has a passcode and you provide it to us, it will be displayed along with the Mtg ID in the meeting notes</li>
    <li>we strongly advise that if your meeting has a passcode, you also provide us with the passcode embedded URL (the longer URL example above)</li>
    <li>if you provide us with the passcode embedded URL, the <b>Join with Zoom</b> button will allow a user to join the meeting without having to manually enter the passcode</li>
    <li><b>NOTE:</b> this passcode embedded URL is well protected, never visible to users or bots</li>
    <li>a few meetings prefer that prospective visitors text or email the group first to obtain the passcode (e.g. text (555) 555-5555 to ask for the password to THE AA GROUP's zoom meeting)</li>
</ul>

Please consider:
<ul class="list_no_indent">
 	<li>by providing us with the passcode embedded URL, in addition to the mtg ID/PWD, visitors will be able to join your meeting by clicking on the <code><b>Join with Zoom</b></code> button without having to type in the password</li>

 	<li>in addition, if your main passcode is non-numeric (e.g. <i>serenity</i>), the one tap contains the purely numeric passcode necessary to join by phone (dial in)</li>

    <b>Zoom has reversed its Sept 27 rollout of a mandatory password or waiting room requirement. Here is an announcement from Zoom released Oct 1, 2020:</b>
    <p style="margin-left: 1em;">“Zoom will no longer be enforcing a mandatory security requirement for your account on September 27, 2020, or at any point thereafter. Here is our updated plan: In November, we will be introducing a new Admin feature which, when enabled, ensures that ALL meetings have at least ONE of the following applied</p>

    <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha; margin: .5em;">
        <li>Passcode</li>
        <li>Waiting Room</li>
        <li>'Only authenticated users can join'</li>
    </ol>
    <p style="margin-left: 1em;">This new feature will be defaulted to 'OFF' - We highly recommend you enable it, but you have the ultimate discretion. This feature can be applied at the Account and/or Group level.”</p>

SIA has developed a solution for groups that would like to move their meetings online. This solution is FREE to groups and leverages their existing SIA email account (ending in
<span style="color: #073fe0;"><b>suffolkny-aa.org</b></span>) and Google Hangout Meets.

If your group hasn't claimed its SIA email account, this is the perfect opportunity to do so. If your group has their account but has misplaced the password, we can help you reset it. See the
<a href="/groups/group-email/">Group Email Account page</a> for details.

To make the request, confirm that you have access to your Group Email Account. Then send us an email at <a href="mailto:websup@suffolkny-aa.org">websup@suffolkny-aa.org</a> with the following info:
<ol style="margin-left: 1em;">
    <li>Group Name</li>
    <li>Town</li>
    <li>Online Meeting Schedule <em>(This could be instead of or in addition to your regular in person meetings. Please
        be specific)</em></li>
    <li>By default the meetings will be listed in our meeting list and therefore public to the entire SIA community</li>
    <li>If instead, you'd prefer the meetings be private, indicate this in the request.</li>
</ol>
